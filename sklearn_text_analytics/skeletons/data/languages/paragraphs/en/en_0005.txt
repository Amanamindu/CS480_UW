The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001[31] and January 13, 2001[32] respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001,[10] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[33] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[27] Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"[34] was codified in its first months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.[27] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.[35]
